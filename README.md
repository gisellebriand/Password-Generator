# Password-Generator

One of the most common misconceptions about password security is that secure passwords consist of words or phrases that seem random to any user other than yourself, like a birthday, secret nickname, or family heirloom. Even passwords like, '3eU7ehxIPQj', are deemed to be of the highest security due to their randomness. However, to a true password hacker, both of these types of passwords are as equally insecure. 

In fact, due to the nature of current password-hacking software, it was found that the most secure type of password consists of at least four regular words put together, and with added numbers, symbols, and/or capitalization makes it even safer. For example, passwords like 'dogtogetherbuildingking' or 'youthfulNemesisMoney@lake' are considered to be highly secure keys to your information. 

Fascinated by this information and building off a project in my Cybersecurity class, I built a random password generator to help people find the most secure password to keep their information and data safe. This program, run on the commandline, has various arguments and features that allow the user to personalize and choose how secure they would like their password to be. With no specifications, the program generates a random four-word all-lowercase password. With the personalizations in the arguments, the passwords only get more secure from there!
